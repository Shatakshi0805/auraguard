## ⚠️ Disclaimer:

All reports currently visible on the platform are **sample/test data only**.  
They are not real reports and are included for demonstration purposes.  
Please do not interpret them as actual incidents.

## 💬 About this Project:
This project was built out of **curiosity**, a **desire to help**, and the hope to make even a small impact.

I've seen how serious and common **women 's safety issues** are - where many incidents go **unreported**, due to fear, shame , or lack of support. Through AuraGuard, I wanted to create a space where people could express what happened to them **anonymously**, without judgment, and maybe feel a little safer doing so.

> These things stay with you. They seem small to the person doing it, but they can lead to **trauma for life**.

The **goal is not to blame or target anyone**, but to:
- Acknowledge that these experiences are real
- Let people speak up, even in small ways
- Show that even one person can try to help

I truly believe that **we can’t fix the big things unless we’re willing to talk about them**.

---
## 🔮 What’s Next – Phase 2 Plans

I’m planning to continue working on AuraGuard and add:
- 📸 Camera/photo evidence 
- 📂 File uploads
- 📍 Smarter location tagging
- 🔐 Optional login system for support follow-ups, method to discard fake reports
- And any features suggested by others!

Your suggestions are always welcome. I’m doing my bit to **build something that matters**, even in a small way.

> 🌍 Just trying to create a safer world, one report at a time.
