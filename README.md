## ✍ About this Project:
Harassment, cat-calling, groping, may seem very small at a large aspect but they often lead to trauma for life ask any person who's been through it. if we're not willing to talk about it we're not ready to solve the problem.

This project was built out of **curiosity**, a **desire to help**, and the hope to make even a small impact.

I've seen how serious and common **safety issues** are - where many incidents go **unreported**, due to fear, shame , or lack of support. Through this project, I wanted to create a space where people could express what happened to them **anonymously**, without judgment.

The **goal is not to blame or target anyone**, but to:
- Acknowledge that these experiences are real
- Let people speak up, even in small ways

> Reporting is the first step towards safety.
a feedback(be it positive or negative) is highly valuable and helpful so i can keep improving the platform for more users to come.
